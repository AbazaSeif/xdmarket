# Solidity Questions

1. Does inheriting contract methods exact a performance penalty?
    # i don't think so - http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#inheritance
2. Is it better to handle a set of items as an array, or a mapping coupled with a counter variable?

3. How to handle events?  Can they be used to store historical data instead of transactions?

    # event data is NOT available inside contracts.
