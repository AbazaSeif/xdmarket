Contract design - for second, less trivial, iteration of market

Works for work/info futures market and partial/whole work, etc.

Hopefully easy to understand as well.

State A: No work done, yet.  Alice wants work done (or information provided)

Offer: Will_Fund ("I will fund 100 shares if FIXED/FOUND, but I require the counterparty to fund 10 shares.")
    user      	            	: Alice
    shares			: 100
    percent_required_to_fund	: 90
    satoshi_per_share		: 2
    
Offer: Will_Fix ("I will fund 10 shares, and receive 100 shares if FIXED/FOUND")
    user     	      	      	: Bob
    shares			: 100
    percent_required_to_fund	: 10
    satoshi_per_share		: 2

The total contract value is: 100% * 100 shares * 2 = 200 satoshi (We can say 100% of 100 shares at price 2 = 200)
Alice and Bob are parties
Alice put 100 * 90% * 2 = 180 satoshi in escrow. (90% of 100 @ 2 = 180) - that's Alices position.
Bob put 100 * 10% * 2 = 20 satoshi in escrow. (10% of 100 @ 2 = 20) - that's Bobs position
Contract 1 is created.
If Bob completes all work, he stands to make 180 satoshi.  Half the work is worth 90 satoshi.
 
State B: Half the work has been done. (Or likelihood of FOUND has gone up)

Offer: Sell_Shares ("I have done 90 satoshis worth of work, and put 20 satoshi in escrow.  I want 110 for my position.")
    user	    	   	: Bob
    shares			: 100
    percent_required_to_fund	: 10
    satoshi_per_share		: 11
    Contract 1 - counterparty is Alice

Offer: Take_Over_Work ("Sure, I'll pay 110 for that contract.  If it's FIXED/FOUND I'll get 200.  I'll make 90 for my work.")
    user			: Cathy
    shares			: 100
    percent_required_to_fund	: 10
    satoshi_per_share		: 11

State C: All work has been done.  

Contract matured as FIXED/FOUND.  Cathy is paid 200.
